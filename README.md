# tiki-home-test

# Create a simple Android project.  

#### Requirement:
+ If the keyword is more than one word, then display in two lines. These two lines should have a minimum difference in length. For example: "nguyễn nhật ánh" should be "nguyễn\nnhật ánh", not "nguyễn nhật\nánh". Because the difference in length of "nguyễn" and "nhật ánh" is less than the difference in length of "nguyễn nhật" and "ánh". 
+ Keywords must be fetched from the link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tikivn/android-home-test/v2/keywords.json 

#### PS:
+ Upload your submission to Github then send me the link.
+ Requirements are very simple. But don't do it sketchily. Pay attention on performance, algorithms. Testing, if any, will be a plus.
